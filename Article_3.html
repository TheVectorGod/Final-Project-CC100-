          Throughout this decade, there has been a significant divide beneath different generations where there is a political dispute that is based solely on perception rather than critical thinking. The nation is currently in a point where it is slowly using the very soul of what kept this country evolving; unity and liberty. There has always been malicious actions behind closed doors especially for those who are in power and how they have more capability than the average Filipino which has been proven to solidify the forces of corruption. Instead of moving forward, the country remains stagnant with no improvements due to those who continue to put these people in power, a change must occur from here on out.

          Although controversial, Filipinos are often not proactive in educating themselves, there seems to be an arrogant side they continue to partake it even with no basis. Research has been accessible as ever and yet this nation fails as wrongful people are constantly in office. Filipinos need to stop giving out benefit of a doubt as a medium for change, the democratic system for voting a particular person in any field shall boil under being certain and sure about any of their credibility, reputation, and accolades. There are genuine politicians out there that promote the right advocacy and aim to be as transparent as they can and yet the popularity of some malicious politicians continue to outshine their efforts.

          It is hard to determine which politician is actually truthful but through actual research and inspecting the patterns, an actual politician can be put in power with the proper vision. In a period where false propaganda and Artificial Intelligence has arrived, Filipinos need to be secure and have to be certain that the information they see is viable. It takes some time but hopefully Filipinos will come together with the same vision for the uplifting of this country, it might be unlikely but if everyone pans their eyes into national triumph, something will happen and for that to happen, something has to truly change. For now, we give the benefit of a doubt that there is one day where it will all work, better days for sure.
