        <h2>Background:</h2>
        <p>
          Years have gone by where the Philippines have slowly submerged in
          different mediums of corruption; affecting those who live a far
          distance from those in power. Change is temporary, but the effect is
          vital, here in TruthLens we aspire to shed light upon the issues of
          corruption from within this nation; big or small and to see everything
          past our naked eye. Advocating not only pure and unbiased news but
          also simultaneously promoting change to finally arrive in this
          long-living country, the people have dealt through too much and it is
          time for something to happen.

        <h2>What is Corruption?:</h2>
        <p>
          Corruption is an act of unethical practices that can be seen in
          different mediums; most commonly recognized within the political
          scene. It may involve different methods such as bribery, influence
          peddling, embezzlement, and fraud. Specifically in the talks of
          politics, it is referred to when a governmental employee acts in an
          official capacity for personal gain. It is a completely fraudulent and
          unethical conduct usually held by those in power.
