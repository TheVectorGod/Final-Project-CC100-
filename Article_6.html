          Residents were optimistic when construction started near the riverbank protection project past August, the project was later discovered to be valued at 96 million pesos but under a different contractor, yet after all this, no work has been done and no procedure has contribute in the community. 
        </p>

        <p>
	        This only counts as one out of many flood control incidents across Bulacan, it is reported by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) after a public set of metadata over completed projects have been released by the president. This exposure has turned into a paveway for further investigations towards contractors suspected of embezzling the funds required for the projects that either never existed or was completely abandoned. 
        </p>

        <p>
	        Oscar Gabriel, the village chief of Sipat has mentioned that the entire community is going under severe frustration by how they were left expecting protection but was instead left on deception, mentioning how the projects just remained postponed. 
        </p>

        <p>
        	Additionally about these ghost projects, locals have found out that many flood control initiatives were built in areas that do not even have any flood risks. Based on the data based on the local analysis, it has been revealed that 411 out of the 668 flood control projects in Bulacan were not located in areas prone to flooding based on the Philippines’ disaster management.
        </p>

        <p>
	        There surely is a clear lack of focus, emphasis, and proper planning as there are evidence resulting to projects that have been rushed or have been put in a direction that divides it from being either postponed or not initiated at all.
