          For the corrupt to face consequences, it requires more than just the political authority of the Marcos Jr. government and the Ombudsman, a judiciary that exercises fair and just judgement is necessary to uphold the nation’s integrity. The Supreme Court’s declaration on July 25, 2025, to bar the impeachment complaint against Vice President Sara Duterte, due to lack of sufficient legal basis, only solidified the Filipino people’s skepticism on the justice system. Decades of patterns of acquittals and reversals of high-profile cases further paint the picture of an incompetent ruling of the Supreme Court and the Sandiganbayan.

          When Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. was convicted by the Court of Appeals for a tax offense, only a penalty of fine was imposed, without the supposed penalty of imprisonment, based on the Tax Code. This is a huge questioning point for the public, why he was able to run for presidency, even if it is legally allowed because as mentioned, he received only a penalty of fine. This partial acquittal demonstrates an inconsistent practice of the law, their lenient handling of this case only leads to widespread criticism, whether they clearly favor the powerful, over those who are not.

          Another rare case was the graft conviction of Imelda Marcos in 2018, in which the Sandiganbayan convicted her on seven counts of graft, as she allegedly funneled funds into Swiss foundations during her time in office. This conviction imposes 6 years and 1 month, up to 11 years of imprisonment for each graft count, which is at minimum is over 42 years, yet as of today, she faces no jail time. It is no surprise that delays in the Supreme Court’s legal process instills doubt into people, even with their reason for this slow disposition being that all legal appeals must be exhausted. However, this pace of the processing is unacceptably slow, even for critics, and it points out a fault at the Philippine court system, which allows the wealthy and powerful to take unjust advantage.

	        Furthermore, in 2014, Juan Ponce Enrile, along with fellow senators Jinggoy Estrada and Bong Revilla, was charged with plunder and multiple counts of graft. Enrile was accused as being a central figure in the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) scam, masterminded by Janet Lim-Napoles. This is one of the times the judiciary have ruled out a system to be unconstitutional, which is a massive showcase of accountability, as it directly removed the primary mechanism of corruption in the scam. It does mean that actions like this are possible, yet it is one of a rare case, and the irony is that, this spawned more innovations on how the powerful exploit the justice system, with Enrile’s controversial bail, which set a precedent later mirrored in Imelda’s case, being handled that way because of old age and health.

        <p>
	        The matter of a judiciary’s integrity lies simply not just in its procedural issues, but of a moral one too. Transparency should be maintained in such proceedings, if they want to increase the public’s trust and cooperation. The way they could achieve this, is to take the people’s calls more seriously, and to fully uphold their own laws and justice, not adjust them based on a person’s power and influence, but by what is objectively just for anyone, regardless of who they are. To fight corruption, is to not just focus on the corrupt themselves, but to make sure that those who pass on judgement and exercise the law, are equally just.
