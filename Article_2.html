          Year 2024, as Undersecretary Bernando also had a large acquisition of funds with money ranging up to P2.8B, an extreme amount. For these particular funds, there was a sought out change in the percentage for the proponent, now reaching 30% for flood control and 25% for other types of projects, pretty odd but a demonstration of how easy the money of the masses is getting passed around.

          As for reference, the most recognizable point of corruption are the largely unsuccessfu efforts to regain assets jeopardized by the Marcos-couple when they were in the office (1965 - 1986) and to at least shed light on gaining justice against the former president’s wife, Imelda Marcus. In 2001, former President Joseph Estrada was charged with patrimonial plunder. His conviction in 2007 exposed a whole network of multiple congress members, governors, police, and officials who were benefiting from people secretly.

          Another project to have in mind is the Northrail project overpricing in 2008, this comes as a subsqeuent scandal that includes overpricing of fertiziler funds that came in 2006 and 2007. There is also the arms procurement kickbacks and illegal “send-off” payments towards the top generals in 2011. PhiHealth pharmally overpricing their services and products back in 2019 and 2020, the renowned pork-barrel scandal and the graft charges against Vice President Binay in 2014. Allegations during 2023 where it involves the Vice President ad Secretary of Eduation spending over 500 million PhP in confidential funds. 
        </p>

        <p>
          All of these scandals follow the same structure and cycle: the media exposes the issue, committee hearings, politicians mentioning smear campaigns, court cases and then comes the acquittals. Surviving in the politics is  a common practice where Estrada was re-elected as the mayor of Manila after his convicton and then his son, Jinggoy, continues his track as a senator albeit the charges against him. Former president Arroyo has gone through multiple cases yet he still remained in power and in the office.

          It is so unfathomable that corruption can be seen everywhere in this nation which is why it is no secret that the country hardly ever advances. This nation carries a lot of funds that should be used for the people because it came from the people but instead, it appears that being in office is such a money-grab that everyone will try their hardest to get involved. It is hard to say that the people are not to blame, because they are the same people who continue to vote for these politicians, inherently advocating for their power even though they have concurrent charges. What the nation is facing now is very fragile but no change willl occur if it does not start with the people themselves. Flipinos must learn how to do their research and to not be easily persuaded by easy propaganda, with that in mind, it should be embedded with the intellect to vote wisely.
