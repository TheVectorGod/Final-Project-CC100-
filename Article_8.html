          Law is supposed to be above all, to see everyone justly and treat them equally, regardless of who they are or what their background may be. However, every day, an influx of news about corruption slowly fostered disillusionment in this current generation. By closing themselves off the endless noise of another politician or public figure, new perspectives are revealed, and one such question lingers: Is the problem really those who rule over the people, or the people themselves who have decided the ruler?
        </p>

        <p>
          Filipinos often adopt a mentality of political tribalism, in which they are incredibly “loyal” to their own in-groups, and treat any opposition as hostile and unjust, often without question. This is especially prevalent in older generations and the less informed populations, where they are basically living in a “bubble”, unable to see past their own side which to them is rightful and sometimes absolute. From this, it is clear how easily people can be fooled and controlled, as it promotes judgement by loyalty instead of actions.
        </p>

        <p>
          That same mindset is deeply rooted in Filipino culture and tradition, which remains strong and dominant even with modern and progressive views. “Utang na loob” is one such factor, as people can and will turn a blind eye to a single act of kindness, whether it was genuine or not, there is always that sense of debt and responsibility to repay someone. Similar in idea, is the family-oriented culture of the Filipinos, we are naturally loyal to our families, friends, and patrons, and that social and emotional connection can outweigh fair judgement. Lastly, is that many Filipinos treat politicians as a personality or celebrity, they base their “goodness” on what these public figures show themselves as, and people often only look at their persona and forget about what their policies actually are. That is not to say that these are inherently bad, but as Filipinos face the same problems again and again, the patterns become increasingly clearer that there is an improper practice of these things.

        <p>
	        On the other hand, the same people affected with this kind of mentality are also most likely the same people who shows the most passion and grit in promoting a leader. This clears any disillusionment and gives a clear purpose to fight for, and a sense of community, a highly important quality for advocating for a good cause. Even so, a good intention doesn’t necessarily result in a good action or effect. That high level of commitment to a political side can blind people from seeing other sides. A clear purpose to fight for could just be an excuse to not do more research about the truth, as most people don’t have the luxury of having to read 50 pages of policies. Same with unity, it can discourage people from having their own actual opinions, these things occur more than the ideal situations, which is exactly why Filipinos should reconsider looking at it from a different perspective.
        </p>

        <p>
	        This is not to say external problems don’t exist, vote-buying, nepotism, disinformation, yet, are those problems all that is at fault? “Hindi pula’t dilaw tunay na magkalaban, ang kulay at tatak ay di syang dahilan”, as long as Filipinos fail to recognize that the root of this long-standing corruption goes beyond just simple colors, we will continue to be taken advantage of by those who only cares about their own interest. Stop worshipping someone, no
